## Problematic

Predict whenever a mail is a spam or not.



## Tasks

- [x] Preprocess Data
- [x] Analyse Data
- [x] Data visualizations
- [x] Apply Machine Learning Models
    - [x] Logistic Regression
    - [x] Support Vector Machine
    - [x] Random Forest
    - [x] KNN
- [x] Django API



<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Our Conclusions

Thanks to this project we could apply what we learned during the practical work and applied different conceptes seen in class such as :

1. Data visualisation with matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
2. Data analysis with pandas and numpy
3. Machine learning with different models

But we alse learned new concepts thanks to this project such as :

1. The Django Framework
2. The collaborative plateform GitHub 
3. Working in a team  

### Result

The best model to predict whenever a mail is a spam is the Random Forest Model with an accuracy of 95% that we applied to the Django API

<!-- DATA -->
## Data 

The data set is from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase.
Its a dataset that contains different attributes such as the frequencies of a word, total number of capital letters, Linked to a label that tells us if its a spam or not.

it contains:

- 48 continuous real 
- 6 continuous real [0,100] attributes of type char_freq_CHAR
- 1 continuous real [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_average
- 1 continuous integer [1,...] attribute of type 
- 1 continuous integer [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_total
- 1 nominal {0,1} class attribute of type spam
